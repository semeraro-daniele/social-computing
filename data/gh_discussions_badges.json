There's no denying the psychological impact these 'banana stickers' are intended to have. They are intended to reward and/or punish people within the scope of social media, which git is not supposed to be. By getting people addicted to chasing meaningless -- and even harmful -- activity, you're getting people addicted to the platform itself. That is, of course, the real intent: Capitalist monopolization through psychological exploitation and (esp in the case of Microsoft) owning every damn thing, software, idea, concept, material work, organization, means of communication, collaborative space, etc. there is. The secondary purpose here is creating and visually quantifying user metadata, which is being gathered on users (inherently anti-privacy) and sold as a product. The concept of open-source was never to monopolize, spy on, or manipulate people. How did our tools for collectivism, cooperation and public good, merely become an opportunity for billionaire plutocrats to turn human privacy into just another thing to sell? Surveillance capitalism, that's how.",

I think the option to mute or hide achievements and achievement notifications we can meet a happy middle ground. Sure they \"game-ify\" PR's to an extent. But the people who just want the badge will get it and move on with their life. No different than any one who just wanted to say they contributed to an open source project just to say they did. I think GitHub is very open for feedback on the different achievements and a few revisions to the achievements could help those looking to \"game-ify\" the experience a bigger contributor. But in the end it's just a cool thing to keep some people engaged.",

This could be because in your PR over here, it could be because the PR was closed and not merged. Try merging another PR within 5 mins instead of closing it, and see if the achievement reappears.   If that doesn't work, it could be a bug. In that case, you would have to raise a ticket to GitHub Bug Report. Explain to them the situation, and provide them at least a few working days to investigate and resolve the issue.   Hope this answers your question, take care \ud83d\ude04",

  "Body": "It was REALLY AWESOME to be made an arctic code vault contributor. Having that shield there under achievements on my profile was really a point of pride. Recently, new achievements have been introduced, and I have a HUGE problem with both content and styling. Styling Remember, people's GitHub profiles form their CVs - they need to convey professionalism. Mine is linked to from LinkedIn, and lots of other places - it's the first place people go to if they need to assess whether they're any good, but it currently looks like Candy Crush Saga. These weird cartoon emoji are massive, and distract the eye from actual content, and hugely trivialise my profile. Content Achievement badges should represent an achievement. It should be possible to see someone's achievement badges and make some assessment of where they are as a contributor and developer. Forced upon my profile I now have: \"YOLO\" which tells people that I merged a PR without a review, generally a bad practice but not really optional if you're the sole maintainer. \"QUICKDRAW\" which tells people that I opened an issue then closed it. On day 1 of using GitHub, probably. \"PULL SHARK\" which tells people that I made a pull request. Literally the most basic aspect of working with git. I acknowledge the need to have achievement badges to encourage beginners, but many fragmented ones diminish those that are meaningful... none of the above are appropriate for a 15-year career developer who spends an average of 3 hours a day on GitHub. A simpler system might be appropriate - \"Getting Started\" could be replaced with \"Moving up\", then with \"Git Hero\" etc, and we'll know where people are at a glance without that panel getting so busy it's meaningless. That would also be actually helpful, because in reviewing developer's CVs (i.e. their GitHub profiles!) it's nice to be able to see at a glance what level they're at with git, especially when hiring at a junior level. There's a new STARSTRUCK one, which is fairly nice as it marks that some of your repos are getting traction in the OSS community, but the styling is still trivialising it, sadly. Suggested course of action It would be good to keep achievements on my profile, rather than have to remove them entirely, because they have the potential to be (and indeed were) a great way of motivating myself and displaying credibility to the world. For this not to be lost: Make sure they're actual achievements, hard-won and meaningful and/or Enable me to curate which ones are shown so my profile still looks professional and I can decide which are meaningful.",

The other half of the problem is the the noise affecting the usefulness GitHub, eg whilst browsing other people's profiles. When hiring devs, for example, the first thing to do is look at someone's GitHub profile to tell whether this is someone mature and established or whether they're raw and junior. Having meaningful achievements supports that, having a load of not-at-all-meaningful achievements prohibits it. If you'd like some evidence that they're not very meaningful, you can check out this other discussion, full of people trying to get a YOLO badge by creating new repositories and fiddling with pull requests for no actual reason. Gamifying GitHub to incentivise good practice might not be a bad philosophy (above the scope of this discussion), but gamifying it to encourage bad practices and additional noise and clutter is surely a very bad plan. There's the opportunity with Achievements to do something really credible and powerful for people's GitHub profiles, and I feel like this opportunity is being squandered.",

It should be fully transparent, and stuff like PRs and discussions made in private repos should not count for the process.

Ability to report and remove someone's badge permanently if it's not authentic. Will prevent people from asking others to star their repo or mark theirs as answers in discussions. Except for Pull Shark and Starstruck badges, the other badges do not support or promote people to contribute to open-source in any way. They must be removed.

I previously contacted GitHub Support, and one of their support engineers mentioned to me that this was an intended change (remove 'Discussions answered' badge & replace it with 'Galaxy Brain' achievement). I understand that there was a period of time where both the Discussions answered badge and the Galaxy Brain achievement could be found in a user's profile.

Should someone have their Galaxy Brain badge revoked / down-leveled if there is a consensus that one or more of the discussions they answered was asking a pretty obvious question? The slope can be kind of slippery. Personally, I view badges as callouts that bring your attention to things you can then track down yourself. If someone had the Starstruck badge I would be inclined to look through their repositories to see which had been starred so much and what it was about. If it was clear that so many people were unlikely to hold a genuine interest in such a repo, that would contribute to my opinion of that person. I guess the tl;dr is that, in the eyes of anyone doing their homework, that effectively becomes a badge of shame.",

I have the following \"achievements\". Ask yourself: Does the developer community want to encourage the behaviour of aiming for these achievements? And are they actually worthwhile things which are in any way difficult?  Apparently I've at some point closed a PR within 5 minutes of it being opened, which sounds more like I made a mistake rather than a useful achievement. I have merged automatically-generated Dependabot PRs by clicking on the \"merge\" button. I created a repository which has \"many stars\". Well that sounds good! Except - \"many\" is only 16, in this case. Oh. I have apparently opened pull requests after they were merged. I'm not sure what this means precisely but it certainly also sounds like a mistake, not an achievement. Arctic Code Vault, which is the one people seem to generally like.",

It's genuinely just gamifying things and encouraging people to do bad things to game a crappy stats engine for asinine rewards. Simultaneously, it's almost discouraging if you're really into this because you have to be Linus Torvalds to get four stars! Unobtainum. Development, for those that actually enjoy it rather than just do it for a pay cheque, has its own rewards. It has its own aspects of fun, flow, achievement. We don't have to be made to feel like we're role players in a real-life Barney The Dinosaur episode to \"make it fun\". It's childish and patronising. Aesthetics are subjective, but seriously, an outdated style cat emoji with stars for eyes? It's just a wannabe attempt at kawaii, with all the charm of a middle-age politician trying to convince the electorate that they're \"down with the kids\".",

It should be fully transparent, and stuff like PRs and discussions made in private repos should not count for the process.

Ability to report and remove someone's badge permanently if it's not authentic. Will prevent people from asking others to star their repo or mark theirs as answers in discussions. Except for Pull Shark and Starstruck badges, the other badges do not support or promote people to contribute to open-source in any way. They must be removed. Ability to turn off certain badges rather than turning off the entire set of achievements.  If you have any other suggestions, additions, or deletions, add them in the comments.

I realise that people want private repos to be shown but that's just gamifying from behind the barrier of closed source development, and allows people to create fake private repos which with trivial automation could easily provide a fair few of the existing badges for nothing. You want badges? Work in open source. I completely support your idea here. Yeah, \"no badges\" vs \"you don't know because they're hidden\" is a useful distinction. I'd have to hope that GitHub would have that covered and I'm not sure I like the idea of people policing each other. Unfortunately, people - especially online - are often nasty and petty and could act maliciously in this regard. Certainly things that are utterly trivial \"achievements\" or could represent bad behaviour are very dubious and I have no idea why they were put there, except to say that the entire feature feels like a bunch of corporate suits with not one iota of clue about actual developers, who are pushing something they speak of in terms of \"increasing engagement\" and \"monetisation opportunities\". GitHub does not need to be a social network. Please, goodness, no; we don't need any more. LinkedIn should have been warning enough. Absolutely, and surely this would be super, super easy to implement. I'm sure any one of us reading here could add a \"hidden\" boolean column to the database and implement a \"remove\" button, with full test coverage, in at most an hour or two.",

I wanted to turn it off, and found this but if you toggle the checkbox and navigate away, it doesn't save, and doesn't warn you that you have unsaved changes. Meanwhile, other checkboxes in my github settings (eg, notifications) apply atomically and are saved right away, without needing to press a button to \"commit\" them. For users who are upset that they've been decorated with flair, at least let them have a single click to remove it \u2013 imagine how more upset they'd be when they try to turn it off and it's still there. It feels intentionally deceptive, even though it's not. Additionally, when viewing one's own profile, there should be a button to remove this \u2013 or at least navigate to the part of the settings page to remove it \u2013 right there. I shouldn't have to go googling. EDIT: more color, because elsewhere someone said this \"wasn't an issue because other UI's make you press a button to save changes\": Many other parts of github's toggle-based settings save on commit, and there is no indication that your change hasn't been saved (no beforeunload handler, no changing of the button from disabled to active, etc). Even the wording \"Update preferences\" implied to me that it would open some other dialog about my preferences related to achievements (perhaps changing their styling or opting into certain badges or something).",

There's \"it's possible to do code review offsite\" but this just seems next-level. e.g., this comment demonstrates that users expect it to mean I did that to someone else. I realize there's a strong possibility people will just tell me to turn off badges, and I already did, but I did not want to--I would like to participate in the silly thing if it's here, having this specific badge in context is just asinine and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. (Especially with the insistent call-to-action to \"update Profile settings\" on my profile after manually turning them off, in Settings.)",

From several conversations about the YOLO badge I see that many people find the messaging problematic; at the same time there are also a lot of questions on how to get this achievement, which suggests to me that the YOLO badge is unreliable, and seeing it on someone's profile does not tell you anything about that developer.",

It could be because I deleted one private repo but it was before 1-2 weeks and nothing happened. I also renamed one project, but not deleted or haven't done anything to it, just rename it.

Actual outcome: Stickybar becomes visible immediately upon scrolling, and no longer disappears, regardless of scrollHeight NOTE: Every reproduction must first start on the Repository Detail Page. Simply refreshing the Profile page will not reproduce the issue. You must go back to the RDP and refresh the page in order to reproduce it. This suggests something is getting in a bad state whenever the router switches pages and a card is already visible(?). Though, that could be a redherring.",

      "Body": "I think what causes the most confusion (at least for me) are the PRs that are shown when you hover over the achievement. These are not all the PRs that are counted but the ones that got you to the next level. Additional confusion comes from the fact that bronze, silver, and gold badge are not constantly displayed as depicted here. You only see them for a short time in the animation when hovering over the symbol. So in my case, I see the standard blue symbol with an x3 attached. When I move the mouse over the symbol I see 3 PRs mentioned and an animation I didn't pay much attention to. So I initially thought there were only 3 PRs counted. However, if you take a closer look, all those 3 PRs have a small note behind them 2nd pull request merged, 16th pull request merged, 128th pull request merged etc. Those are the numbers that get you to the next level. The mentioned PR is the one that let you progress to the next level. The animation in my profile first shows the silver badge, then the bronze badge, and finally the default symbol. So the counting seems to be correct (in my case), it is just the presentation of the badge that is somewhat unintuitive. When I visit the profile of @ExposedCat , I come to the conclusion that he was also confused by this. If you scroll down in the profile he has a small GitHub stat table that says he has merged 30 PRs. The Achievement reflects this by awarding him the bronze version (2x at the achievement symbol, the 2 \"milestone PRs\" listed, and a bronze badge at the start of the animation). So everything seems to be correct there. Suggestion I think all this confusion can be avoided if the badge is redesigned to be more intuitive:  the static symbol should directly reflect the current status. Show the bronze, silver, or gold image in the profile once achieved and not the default symbol with a multiplier attached to it Flip the order of the animation. IMHO it doesn't make sense to show the highest achievements just for a second and then the lowest one for the rest of the time. It should start at the lowest and raise to the current level which is then displayed continuously. This alone would probably help a lot with the confusion. Add a counter of the total PRs and maybe a target number for the next level. Place it over the \"history\" so that it is immediately visible how many PRs were counted. Maybe make the \"history\" erties a bit more descriptive: \"Achived bronze status by merging his 16th pull request: LINK_TO_PR\"  Here is a related suggestion in a separate topic",

  "Body": "I just sponsored a project and now my profile page is cluttered with badges: one for sponsorship, the other for achievement. I need an option to hide these badges, especially Achievements, which are total nonsense. Worst of all, these two badges display above the list my Organizations, moving information that is important and accessed frequently to a less accessible place. In the end GitHub is a tool for doing my work and these badges make it less useful and more cluttered - Achievements in particular. I'm sure I can remove the sponsorship badge by cancelling the sponsorship, but will this remove the Achievements as well? EDIT: I realized I can hide the sponsorship information, but that still shows empty Sponsorship section on my profile and doesn't hide the Achievements.",

In the multiple source branches. Lots of improvements, back and forth and testing. But without the click on github pull's sanctioned approve button. Because we communicate all the time about our code but not always asynchronously through github. The badge shows a link to the giant pull with \"Merged without a review\" text next to it, which is kind of funny, totally inaccurate. It would be better for the text to be \"Merged without someone clicking github's approve button\". I used to like the github tags, I thought they were fun. I'm going to uncheck the show achievements button, because these achievements don't represent anything about the quality and dedication of contributing to shared projects.",

  "Body": "Background Github Achievements can be a great way to allow open source developers to build up their reputation. Tokenized reputation is one of the big themes in web3 alongside decentralized identity and proof of humanity. The soulbound NFT whitepaper framed the discussion and accelerated research. Github achievements can be a great soulbound fit. https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-soulbound-tokens-building-blocks-for-a-web3-decentralized-society The Problem Currently Github Achievements do not seem to be immutable. It is less incentivizing for developers to strive to earn achievements knowing that they may disappear on a whim. Achievements would have more credible value if they are immutable. Once a developer earns a badge, it should become a permanent part of their dev reputation history. Solution: One option is to partner with POAP , Gitcoin, Arbitrum Nova, Immutable X, Pinata or any other credible NFT infrastructure project. Mint Github acheivements as inexpensive blockchain NFTs.",

The most I have seen anyone have yet is bronze at 2, but it doesn't make sense, because I have definitely opened far more in other repositories. I feel like these achievements should encourage people to contribute to open source projects that aren't their own, but the only 2 PRs I get credit for are one in my own repo and one in a repo that an org I am a member of owns. EDIT: Okay, fine, I figured out what it means by x2. Just second stage, and you have giant gaps between stages in an exponential fashion. That makes it a little better, I guess, but I still believe it should be pull requests that you could not merge yourself. It would be a much better badge if it instead encouraged contributing to different repos. Even that wouldn't even be fantastic because you could be encouraging people who work on a labor of love to instead ditch something they've contributed a great deal to.",

  "Body": "I have several notes and suggestions about the \"Public Sponsor\" profile badge: Whenever you sponsor a new person, the badge currently replaces your \"1st sponsorship\" with them. I have sponsored various individuals over the years, but my \"1st sponsorship\" is now someone that I have only sponsored for a month. Past sponsorships are not included, so \" @ajmeese7 is sponsoring 4 organizations or users.\" does not acknowledge the other users I have supported over the years that I am not a current sponsor of. I would like to see the message change to something along the lines of \" @ajmeese7 is currently sponsoring 4 organizations or users and has sponsored a total of 11.\" One idea is the inclusion of a tier system like with many of the other badges for total users/organizations sponsored. Tiers could be 1, 4, 16, and 64 users or something along those lines, to give additional recognition if a user has been financially supporting a large number of other users. This could also be for number of months or something, it does not necessarily have to be on a per-user/org basis. Having a display of the profile pictures of all the users/orgs that a user has financially supported over the years, possibly with a hover feature indicating the total months sponsoring that person and the overall monetary contribution.",

Achievement badges should be opt-in to show, not opt-out, and definitely not mandatory.

I also went through the list of Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile? and starred to all the work repositories which my work email had made commits in. I also restored my GPG and SSH keys and have SSO authorized the SSH. I'm only seeing the badges from the personal account, is this expected behavior? Does the entire commit graph need to finish rebuilding first? Will I just have to re-earn any badges which I no longer have? I did notice that after starring all the private repositories of the organization there are still ~400 attributions missing even when I'm signed into the Orgs SSO. Signing into the Org SSO has a minimal impact on total contributions. I recall that combined I was around 650-750 contributions for the year with a bit below/above 200 in personal and 400+ in the Org. Now its ~240 total: 243 Not logged in / Incognito looking at profile: 242 Logged into account, but not Org SSO: 243 Logged into account and Authenticated to SSO: My suspicion is the missing contributions are why badges are missing. Are there any suggestions on investigating missing contributions? Or maybe tracking down all contributions for a deleted/ghost account to try and compare which ones are not in my graph?",

Now both emails are attached and verified under this one account. The missing commits went into private Org repos, not personal ones. I have starred each of those repos after merging/verifying the email to this account. The deleted account had maybe 5 personal repositories, but had minimal commits/merges. Maybe 10-20 contributions would be lost from allowing those personal repositories to be deleted. what else might you be missing ? I don't know, that is why I am asking here. :) they are just 2-3 commits missing ? No, hundreds. There were 350-450 commits in the work account before deletion. I recall reviewing 2022 commits for both accounts last week and the combined total was around 650-700 and I presumed 800-1000 would be my end of year totals. For comparison I just went and unstarred 6 of the Org private repositories. I worked on each of these repositories in the last 3 months, and definitely many many times this year. There should be at least 100 commits related to these repositories, if not at least 200-300. My graph still shows I have 243 commits for 2022, identical to the number of contributions before unstarring these repos. If I choose to expand my Contribution Activity the Organizations repositories do not showup at all, as if I had never contributed in any way except from my personal email address.",

My total contributions say 243. I remove the star from this repository and 5 others which would have much greater contributions than this example. 10 minutes later my contributions still say 243. So even though it has linked past contributions to my current account which has the email attached, they do not appear to be included in contribution graphs regardless of adding a \u2b50 to the repository or not and I can clearly see things attributed to my current account for specific dates are showing as 0 for that same date in my profile.",

I gave examples of matching the contribution requirements still and of a url, .patch and missing dates in the graph to github support, they recalculated contributions for those repositories. However I was still missing over 1/2 of the contributions. It turns out when the merging accounts page stated:  To attribute past commits to the new account, add the email address you used to author the commits to the account you're keeping. For more information, see \"Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile?\"  One should infer (although I did not at the time) that Pull Requests, Issues and Discussions will not be attributed to the new account. Unfortunately since this was not explicitly stated in either page I presumed that I could get back all contributions. If this was more clearly stated I might have decided initially to not create two accounts and later try to merge them. I hope this discussion helps others better understand the ramifications of merging accounts on past contributions.",

This is great! @ChristopherHX has been providing some amazingly descriptive \u270d\ufe0f answers in the community. @kuisathaverat has been looking to define an environment variable Global to a job but did not use the correct environment which @ChristopherHX did in his really well crafted solution. \ud83d\udcaf Sharing the updated info \u2139\ufe0f with the author of actionlint . @rhysd was not sure about an indented behavior of reusable workflow. @ChristopherHX helped with a detailed response and his documentation is spot on! \ud83c\udfc5 Let\u2019s look at this self-solve \u2714\ufe0f by @schalkneethling realizing that the default GITHUB_TOKEN would\u2019ve solved the error. Thanks for coming back and updating the discussion. \u26a1 GitHub Universe - Agenda is Live! \ud83c\udf10 We\u2019re super excited \ud83d\ude2e for GitHub Universe and the countdown \ud83d\udcc5 has begun. It is less than a month from now and we have the list of agenda on our hands. You will have the chance to explore 80+ content sessions delivered by over 120 different speakers, across two days and four content tracks, all designed to level up your skills. Read more about the agenda here . To get even more excited check out the two great ways to experience everything GitHub Universe has to offer this year from @lclindeman \ud83d\ude80 From the Release Radar \ud83d\udea8 GitHub Actions: Deprecating save-state and set-output commands \ud83c\udd95 FYI, to avoid untrusted logged data to use set-state and set-output workflow commands without the intention of the workflow author we have introduced a new set of environment files to manage state and output. Here\u2019s more details on the change. GitHub Actions: GitHub Actions: larger Hosted Runners now support -latest tag \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f GitHub now supports using the -latest image label on your larger hosted runners. With the -latest label developers can be sure that their workflows use the latest available GA image in GitHub Actions. Are you interested in learning more about larger hosted runners? Read the announcement here or sign up for the beta here . \ud83d\udce2 GitHub Actions: Jobs running on macos-latest are now running on macOS 12 \ud83d\uddb1\ufe0f This is a much anticipated change, and over the next 10 weeks, jobs using the macos-latest runner label will migrate from macOS 11 to 12. You just need to include runs-on: macos-latest in your jobs. Packages: Consolidated owner and admin role \ud83d\udce6 We\u2019re merging identical privileges that the admin role and original poster of the package used to have into a single authority to ease out the overall process. So, now by default, both the original publisher and the organization owner will have admin privileges on that package. Checkout this document to know more. \u262e\ufe0f",

Projects are getting bigger and big so why should the limit stay the same? Unity files can easily exceed 100MB and yes I know Git LFS is an option but it is a pain in the neck to use and the limits are small, I exceeded the limit within 5 days of me uploading a file. Thank you again for the post!",

  "Body": "Cloning and forking repositories on GitHub One of the main benefits of using a version control system is the ability to acquire your own copy of a project quickly and easily. The two most commonly used methods for copying a repository on GitHub are cloning and forking . Tip: If you just need an archive of repository contents, click the Code button on its home page and look for Download ZIP . What is cloning? Repositories created on GitHub exist as remotes . When you clone a repository you are creating a local copy on your computer that you can sync with the remote on GitHub. Cloning is ideal for contributing directly to a repository alongside other users while utilizing branching and other collaboration tools to manage changes. Tip: Cloning a repository can be used to create a backup that is regularly kept up to date, but it's important to note that although your clone will copy over Git data like files and commit history, it won't bring over issues, pull requests, and other GitHub elements. To clone, head to the main page of a repository and click the green Code button. In the dropdown that appears you will have the option to clone over HTTPS , SSH , or by using the GitHub CLI . What about forking? A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to make your own changes without impacting the original project. A fork differs from a cloned copy in that it doesn't allow for direct collaboration with the root using local commands like git push and git pull . Instead, your fork exists on GitHub and you can contribute back to the original project using Pull Requests . You can also synch your fork easily to keep it up-to-date with changes from the root repository. Forks are ideal for situations where the root repository is serving as a basis for further iteration, or to play around with ideas -- instead of starting a project from scratch you can use an existing repository as a foundation then take it to the next level! Tip: Keep in mind when working with a fork of a private repository that GitHub will consider the owner of the root repository to have ownership of its forks as well. This means that when a private repository is deleted any of its forks will also be removed. This isn't something to worry about for public repositories as in that case the fork is owned by the fork owner and will be detached or re-routed in the case a root is deleted. Forking a project is as easy as clicking the Fork button in the header of the repository home page. Once the process is complete you'll be taken to your forked copy where you can start collaborating! Forking a repository will copy data such as files and code but Issues, branches, pull requests and other features won't join the party. Instead, your fork will start the same way as a newly created repository so you can begin work on it as a fresh project. Further Reading Now that you know which method to use when making a new copy of a project, here are some other resources for getting comfortable working with forks and clones: Understanding the GitHub Flow Configuring a remote for a fork Which remote URL should I use?",

Documentation is key make sure the readme file has details required to use your lib, SDK etc... and yeah make sure also throw in screenshots to show off any UI if your repo provides them. Use badges. This will help identify the env and the min, max and current version of the repo.  External Sources  Write a blog post about the problem at hand and how the repo, lib, SDK etc... solves the issue. Share them on linked in, twitter, and other socials. (I usually don't share the repo instead I share the blog post which makes for better SEO so google picks it up faster :P )",

You can use this tool to generate the contents of your readme, and this one to add your statistics. Here's GitHub's step-by-step profile README tutorial. Another approach is using GitHub Actions to update your readme whenever an event triggers the action. There are actions such as this, this, and many more. You can add all the info you want to make it handsome. You can also code your own action using GitHub GraphQL and REST APIs to get the info you want, and update the readme with that info. It can be displayed in SVG and you can use CSS for colors and animations. Take a look at my profile to see this approach. Finally, take a look at this repository as it has a collection of readme profiles. You may get inspiration by looking at different profiles.",

  "Title": "New achievements are counterproductive",

  "Date": "2022-06-10T00:53:15Z",

  "Body": "I'm seeing a couple of new achievements in my profile. They are: 'YOLO': seemingly for merging pull requests without reviews 'Pull Shark': for having opened pull requests that have since been merged. Having achievements displaying on a user page always risks giving the impression that the user actively sought out those achievements; that they are an 'achievement hunter'; that they endorse and are proud of whatever achievements are displaying. That's not the case with these achievements - they don't reward any special behaviour, only arbitrary numbers and activities. They don't give the impression that I'm a professional developer, but that I'm a novice coder who's just finished my first project. A potential employer glancing at my profile, perhaps unfamiliar with this very niche GitHub-specific feature, might assume a negative impression of me. These specific achievements only emphasise my issue. As a developer I don't particularly want to have YOLO and a shark face plastered on my profile - I feel that they might be of more interest to a demographic far younger than me. The achievement names seem to support this - 'Galaxy Brain' referring to a meme and 'YOLO' being another meme, albeit a decade old. (I don't know if 'Pull Shark' is a reference to anything, but I assume that it is, because it doesn't mean anything to me otherwise.) But even beyond the theme, these achievements don't encourage positive behaviours. As anyone who's tried to set up KPIs on a bunch of developers will tell you, it's really difficult to measure and reward developer progress numerically. 'Pull Shark' for example incentivises opening pull requests, but not, say, opening good or useful pull requests (it does require that the pull requests are eventually merged, which is a nice touch). 'YOLO' appears to be a one-off, which is far better than incentivising creating and merging pull requests in a junk repository with reckless abandon - but in that case, what's the point of rewarding that at all? 'Pull Shark' is especially reductive: it displays on my profile as \"Pull Shark x 3\", which could be read as my having merged 3 pull requests - but clicking into it reveals that I've actually merged at least 128, with the number in the achievement title seemingly being found by $\\lfloor \\log(4 *n) /( 3 * log(2)) \\rfloor$ where $n$ is the PR count - if that's the case, I could have merged anywhere between 128 and 1023 pull requests and this achievement wouldn't care. To compare these to the two extant achievements that I'm aware of: 'Arctic Code Vault Contributor': not a useful achievement, because it's more of an advertisement for something that GitHub is doing than something the user has done specifically. Practically everyone active in open source has it - no personal value 'Mars Helicopter 2020 Contributor': describes something discrete and meaningful, and acts as a community rallying point. Really cool. An excellent achievement with genuine personal value - I wish I had it! Overall, my feedback for the new achievements (those that I'm aware of, anyway), is that they are not particularly useful and even a little harmful. I feel that new achievements should reward specific achievements rather than hitting arbitrary quotas.",

The YOLO badge especially can potentially portray a developer in a negative light - As a rule breaker/ protocol breaker/ someone who doesn't follow processes.

It sucks out the creativity, and blocks out future innovation for the process itself. GitHub might be shooting itself in the foot here. Will we see alternative code hosting services that are non-opinionated, i.e. don't dictate what the process of authoring and deploying code should be like?.

For example, Discord used to be a decently good chatting platform before they started focusing on Nitro and \"communities\" instead of what they used to be for. (Mostly because of the pandemic and they could score revenue there), but they ended up modernizing for the bad. With the newest improvements with GitHub, I can tell this is where it's going to go. Most people who use GitHub are about over the age of 16, and the designs of, for example, the Pull Shark icon looks like something from cocomelon, and I don't think anyone wants something remotely percieved as childish shown on their profile. Also, as I said earlier, if they could manage to do this properly, it would go pretty well. Instead of maybe turning it into achievements they could make it some type of trophy system, that could only be visible to you (or mutual followers) where it would show how many commits, repos, pr's, etc. Something that isn't easy to get and actually worth a trophy.",

But do not like their superficial characteristics, name or look-and-feel of the emblem. While I do like getting achievements and this seems like it adds motivation to contribute to open-source, I find the actual way that these achievements are named and how they look to be somewhat off. The pull shark from a distance (I'm kind of old) looked like some kind of a scary ghost, skull or monster. Plus, some contributors (if they figure out the pull shark is actually a shark) might sincerely be afraid of sharks, or similar attributes. I think the symbology of the emblem chosen for this award sends off the wrong vibe. I'm also sceptical of the one with the brain. What does it mean to not get the brain? Does it mean differentiation regarding cognitive ability? This is too competitive and might be offensive in certain occasions. I understand that achievements need themes, but is there any way to choose more neutral themes. The pink unicorn whtn GHA is full loaded seems OK for me. Hardly anyone is afraid of unicorns. Maybe ther is another idea with less potential for fear/comparison/competitive negativeness...?",

Also take advantage of GitHub's markdown:  https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax",

      "Body": "Hi, to get the Galaxy Brain achievement badge, you need to fulfill the following criteria:  Discussions should be in a public repository Get marked as answers to 2 or more questions The questions cannot be asked by you. In short, you cannot answer your own questions, those do not count. There's a current bug observed by some users whereby marking your own answers can prevent you from getting the badge instead. Reference: I've answered 2 discussions but they don't gave me the Galaxy Brain badge. #18454 Hope these steps help you in achieving your badge! Good luck :)  More details here: https://github.com/Schweinepriester/github-profile-achievements",

I'm almost 40. I don't need little dopamine hits when I'm working on code, I'm working on code, that's what I do for dopamine. I don't want the services I'm using to RECOGNIZE AND REACT TO WHAT I'M DOING AT ALL. Stop paying attention. I want the services I'm using to function. I want stupid services that work. Hopefully well. Services are not my friends, they're services. This isn't a playground, it's where I work. I notice it says beta next to the badge. So now you're pushing me into beta programs without asking me if I want to participate. Bold move. I already don't want to use Github after using all of the code you've collected over the years for the AI code assistant that I would have to pay for even though our work made it possible. GITHUB. STOP. ALL. OF. THIS. I don't have a facebook account. I don't have a snapchat account. I don't have a tiktok account. Why are you ruining this? The git server I host at home doesn't do any of this. I don't want to put it behind DynDNS and deal with setting up the firewall, auth etc. That's all Github is. It takes care of some annoying things for me. If it becomes more annoying than the problems it solves, it ceases to be a viable alternative to just doing it myself. Bitbucket and Gitlab don't do any of this social media marketing nonsense. WHY. ARE. YOU. DOING. THIS? This does not improve anything fundamental to the service. Look, my work uses github. I don't want to use a different service for work and personal projects if I can possibly help it, I have enough context switching with OS, text editor, and frameworks. Please, I'm soooo close to switching, and I don't want to. I don't want to learn another UI. I don't want to update my .gitconfig username and walk away, BUT I WILL IF I LAND IN ONE MORE BETA. You looking for a strong reaction. Here it is. NO. This is AWFUL. OPT ME OUT. Pull Shark? I send potential employers and clients here sometimes, do I need to worry that they will think I am a child if I continue to use your platform? WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO FIX SOMETHING THAT WORKS? STOP.

      "Body": "I do understand your concerns @blanketcat (though it's not clear if you are trolling or mean this seriously, given your profile mentions being a GPT-3 troll \ud83d\ude01). Like you, I have lots of experience. I have been programming since I was five, and I love code so much, I ended up teaching students how to program for a living. Having been around through the birth of the open source era, with GNU, emacs, vim, Linux, and then SourceForge, Napster, Shareaza, Gnutella, etc., ... I can tell you that GitHub has done more good globally for programming literacy and advocacy of open source than any other company on the planet. GitHub has, at scale, had a tremendous impact on programmers by helping them provide organized work. The nudges to submit a README.md, to have rules of conduct, of contribution, to have easy to use tools to submit issues, to have ever more integrated and smart workflows \u2014 all of these things help more and more people find it accessible to write usable and reusable code, and I think that bringing as many creative minds to software engineering is a good thing for the world. This gamification may feel patronizing to some, and so, it's great that it can be turned off. But it does have a positive impact, especially in the open source community where many, for several decades, were locked in silly flamewars with no real world impact. To put it another way, I think GitHub is one of those rare platforms that harnesses the value of a social platform the best. It is one of the few social media platforms that is not performative, where what matters is your work. It is a perfectly reasonable position to think that GitHub is a valuable social network, which has supported the growth of many public goods, in opposition to Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, that are advertising companies in disguise \u2014 that benefit from engagement at the expense of quality engagement.",

However, it says \"inaccessible\" next to 2nd pull request merged - is that a bug? or does it think I haven't had a second pull request merged? In the last 6 years I've had several hundred merged for various companies I've worked for so does it only count merged PRs in public repositories? It doesn't say that. What does bronze and silver mean? were they both unlocked on 28th Nov 2018? How does the \"x3\" relate to the \"bronze and silver\" or the \"2nd, 16th, 128th\" it mentions variously? I don't really understand how to interpret any of this, and whilst I might just be being a bit slow today, I've used github for years so it makes me think new users might also be confused.",

In short, you cannot answer your own questions, those do not count. In fact, answering your own questions could prevent the achievement from displaying in your profile page. My advice here is to perhaps scour a few discussion forums, and answer a few questions based on your own knowledge/expertise. Perhaps if someone finds your answer helpful, he/she would mark your answer and thus help you to unlock the badge.  Hope these steps help you in achieving your badge! Good luck :)",

YOLO - Merge a PR directly without review (can add a friend as a reviewer). Repo should be public. Pull Shark - Merge at least 2 PRs into a public repo. Galaxy Brain: Answer at least 2 discussions. Take note, you CANNOT mark your own answers to your own questions. They have to be marked by another user. Discussions should be in a public repository. Also if you mark answers to your own questions, there could be a bug whereby the achievement won't show despite having >=2 answers marked by other users. Reference: I've answered 2 discussions but they don't gave me the Galaxy Brain badge. https://github.com/orgs/github-community/discussions/18454 Also, please provide a couple of hours (or maybe up to a day) for your new achievements to show. If they haven't shown by then, perhaps you did not hit some \"hidden\" criteria. In most cases, developers seem to get their achievements instantly though. Contact 'Github Support' if you face any issues. The community can feel free to chime in, and provide their own observations on how the requirements of the new achievements, in case I may have missed some stuff out. Hope this answer has helped you, and all the best in getting the achievement! :)",

  "Body": "Hello, I want you to give my 2 cents about the new achievements feature on GitHub. Personally, I am questioning why features like this are prioritized. I understand that in a large company like GitHub, there are a lot of people simultaneously working on different features but in my view, this feature is really unnecessary. In my opinion, GitHub tries to become a social media platform now and I really dislike that. It always was an open space where you were able to connect with other developers for awesome projects, share knowledge and experiences and help each other out. A feature like achievements just feels so competitive. It really feels like: the more you have on the profile, the better you are. People will start to compare and measure their performance through this. Another aspect that should not be neglected is that many companies also have access to an applicant's achievements through their GitHub profile. People tend to feel pressured though things like that and achievements make it even worse. I am aware that you can disable achievements on your profile but as previously mentioned this has other psychological side effects. \"Why is this developer hiding their stats? Are they so bad?\" Please reconsider if you really want to make GitHub the next social media platform while there are so many other feature requests that could make some use of some attention.",

I don't know if it was intended, but the Pull Shark achievement also worked with my own repositories (e.g., I created a repository, then I created a pull request on it, then I myself merged that pull request).

Because there are such discussions not only in the organization of the github community And about the second, yes, I myself don\u2019t understand why the github did it. I think the pull shark achievement should only be given by other repositories that we don't own. This is how the meaning of all these achievements is preserved. If it's not hard, you can make the question the main one. I will be pleased",
